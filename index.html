      Q1. What is box model?
      <br />
      Answer: A box that wraps around every single html element, includes
      margin, border, padding, and content. By default width and height are for
      the content, which is equivalent to content-box.
      <br />
      By setting box-sizing to border-box, it'll make the width and height fit
      to include content, padding, and border. The two boxes below are example
      of non-border box and border-box.
      <br />
      Usually we include box-sizing:border-box in the * category in CSS.
    </div>
    <div class="df--container">
      <div class="container--default">default box.</div>
      <div class="container--border-box">border-box.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container container--Q2">
      Q2. What is specificity?
      <br />
      Answer: Specificity is a weight given to a style to determine if it should
      be applied or not. For example, if you give a div two different background
      color in the CSS like below, it'll use the whichever comes last.
      <br />
      div {
      <br />
      background-color: black;
      <br />
      }
      <br />
      div {
      <br />
      background-color: red;
      <br />
      }
      <br />
      <br />
      If you give div a background-color and the class of the div a
      background-color, it'll use the class' background-color because it has a
      higher specificity.
      <br />
      id > class > div/span/etc. If you add !important, then it'll take highest
      priority, exmaple below.
      <br />
      div {
      <br />
      background-color: red !important
      <br />
      }

      Q3. How to center a div?
      <br />
      Answer: First option is to use display: flex, justify-content: center, and
      align-items: center.
      <br />
      The second option is to use position: relative and position: absolute,
      then adjust the top, left, and transform to center the inner div.
      <br />
      top: 50%;
      <br />
      left: 50%;
      <br />
      transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
      <br />
      By using top and left, the top left point of the inner div will be at the
      center of the outer div, then we transform: translate it to center the
      center point of the inner div to the outer div.
      <br />
      A third option is to use display: flex in the outer div and use margin:
      auto on the inner div.
      <br />
      display: grid and display: flex have some similarities, so remember to
      also check that as an option as well.

      Q4. What is the difference between "div" and "section"? <br />
      Answer: Divs are just used to group elements together, doesn't have a
      specific meaning.
      <br />
      Sections are used to group together elements that are related to each
      other, typically structured with headings then paragraph text etc.

      Q5. What is the difference between block, inline, and inline-block?
      <br />
      Answer:
      <br />
      Display: block starts on a new line and takes up the whole width e.g. "p"
      elements.
      <br />
      Display: inline starts on the same line and can't set the width and
      height, e.g. "span" elements.
      <br />
      Display: inline-block starts on the same line but you're allowed to set
      the width and height.

      Q6: Difference between position relative, absolute, fixed, sticky, and
      static?
      <br />
      Answer:
      <br />
      Position: static is the default position property. top, right, bottom,
      left does not affect the positioning of static.
      <br />
      Position: relative is usually used along with position: absolute, it
      functions similarly to position: static but can be moved by using top,
      right, bottom, left. It can overlap with other objects on the screen.
      <br />
      Position: absolute makes the object itself no longer associate with other
      objects on the webpage, and also has a default width of 0, which needs to
      be changed to whatever you need it to be.
      <br />
      Position: fixed makes the object fix to a position relative to the
      screenspace, and it'll not move when you scroll. This is useful for making
      buttons and other functions that needs to be permanently available on the
      screen.
      <br />
      Position: sticky toggles from position: static to position: fixed. It'll
      not disappear off the screen. Which is similar to a sticky note.

    <div class="container container--Q7">
      Q7. Difference between visibility: hidden, and display: none?
      <br />
      visibility: hidden will make an empty render of the space that the object
      takes, but it is still there and can be interacted. For example, even if
      you make a button that links to a webpage disappear with visibility:
      hidden, you can still slick in that space and it'll still do what it's
      supposed to do.
      <br />
      display: none essentially removes the code that you wrote for that div.

      Q8. How to build a triangle in CSS?
      <br />
      Answer: A simple way to make traingle is to use box-sizing: border-box.
      and then make the content have 0 width and height. This'll make the box
      get divided to 4 borders, which can make a triangle shape.
      <br />
      There is another way to make more advanced shapes by making a block of
      object and rotating it.
